// This project should locate the 'weight' for each file in a project and genereate a report.
// This weight can be for files.

// Weight is dependent on lines of code, amount of for loops, if statements, and other tokens.
// line of code = 1 point
// for loop = 2 points
// if statement = 3 points
// the above is configurable via ~/.w8/config.yml
